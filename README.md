# To-Do List Full Stack App with Express, Node.js, MongoDB

This is a simple to-do list full stack application that allows the user to add tasks to the list, clear the whole list, check off completed tasks, and clear the check marks as well.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

I had originally created this application only on the front-end, so this time I took the original project and created it on the server-side as well. This was definitely a difficult process, as it was interesting to think of how to integrate the client-side JavaScript I had created with the CRUD methods that I've learned.

## Lessons Learned:

I now have more practice with creating CRUD apps and the back-end development is getting to be more clear now. With this project specifically, it would have been easier to start from scratch than to incorporate my previous code with my new backend skills.
